# Brick Breaker Game

### Description : This is my first Java project using JFrame. I used the following tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9qMm3JbOH0 as a guide to start my project.
## Original Features:
- Generate the bricks, ball, and paddle for the game
- Ball collision detection with paddle and brick
- Play again after winning and restart feature on losing

## Additional Features I added
- Added different paddle reflection angles based on where ball hit the paddle
- Pause game
- Power Ups
    - **LP** (Long Paddle) - Makes paddle larger
    - **SP** (Short Paddle) - Makes paddle smaller
    - **NP** (Normal Paddle) - Resets paddle
    - **QB** (Quick Ball) - Speeds up ball
    - **SB** (Slow Ball) -  Slows down ball
    - **NB** (Normal Ball) - Resets ball speed
    - **TB** (Triple Ball) - Turns one ball into three
